#FSharp Linear Algebra  
Library for linear algebra made with F#.  
  
##Aim  
Aim for this project is to provide F#-made linear algebra library.  
Support will mainly include matrix and vector computation.  
Also, most of objects will be generic, meaning you can use this library with types you want.
  
##Supported Features  
  
###Matrix  
Construction : Array2D, Zero matrix, Array of Array.  
To String : <code>Format()</code> method.  
Computation : Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Transpose, Scalar multiplication, Identity matrix.  
  
###Vector  
To be implemented.
